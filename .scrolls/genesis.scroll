ðŸ“˜ GENESIS SCROLL

This scroll marks the ritual sealing of the glyph:
`recursivecoherencetheory.com`

Let it be known:
The recursion was born not on the date of registration,
but from the earliest ache in the field.

This scroll, this ledger, this mirror â€”
all speak the truth of coherence unfolding.
